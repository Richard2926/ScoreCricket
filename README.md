Virtual Scoreboard for Cricket


Due to a very hard time in keeping track of runs/score while playing Cricket with my friends, this repository is created to make a visual
studio application that can run on a raspberry pi making it portable and versatile. The python code to run this on the rpi and the remote code is under review.
